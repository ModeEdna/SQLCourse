# Obtain a table containing the following three fields for all individuals whose employee number is no greater than 10040:
# - employee number
# - the smallest department number among the departments where an employee has worked in
# (use a subquery to retrieve this value from the 'dept_emp' table)
# - assign '110022' as 'manager' to all individuals whose employee number is less than or equal to 10020,
# and '110039' to those whose number is between 10021 and 10040 inclusive (use a CASE statement to create the third field).
# If you've worked correctly, you should obtain an output containing 40 rows. 
# Hereâ€™s the top part of the output.
